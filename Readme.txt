    **confirm.php : no proper info was provided in assignment sheet so i was unable to create it separately, although i believe the feature has been provided in another file name.
	if the project is creating problem then it was due to node modules (70 MB).
	the logged out to logged in pages mannual redirection has also been taken care of.
